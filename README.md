# UnityBombWithSpeech
This project is a course work for TU-Sofia ( VirtualEngineering ) 
The whole project is consisted of a dictionary of a string (the word the mic picks up) and the function pointer (also known as delegate)
The words to move the object are (forward,backward,right,left). 
After you have it in the right direction  you can check the physics with the word ("explode"). There will be an animation on the bomb ,followed by a beautiful explosion , pushing all the blocks
that are in range of the explosion radius .
